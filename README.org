Retrieve definitions (meanings) and synonyms for German words with Emacs.

** TODOS

*** NEXT Add synonyms from Wiktionary
There is already some code in the file that sort of works.

*** TODO Add tests to cover more

** TODO Add image before Main features

** Main features                                                :noexport_0:

    - Retrieve definitions (meanings) or synonyms for a word and
      - display in an Org-mode buffer,
      - insert into the current Org-mode buffer, or
      - add to the kill ring as Org-mode syntax.
    - Retrieve definitions and synonyms simultaneously.
    - Select a synonym for a word and
      - insert it into the current buffer,
      - replace the word at point with it, or
      - add it to the kill ring.

The word used for retrieval can be read from the minibuffer or taken from point.

Definitions are retrieved from [[https://www.dwds.de/]] and synonyms from [[https://www.openthesaurus.de/]]. Optionally synonyms from https://de.wiktionary.org can be retrieved as well.

If anyone knows a better way to get definitions or synonyms than parsing Dwds and Wiktionary, please open an issue. [[https://github.com/hdaSprachtechnologie/odenet][Open German WordNet]] looks promising but needs time to mature.
